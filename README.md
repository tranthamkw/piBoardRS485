# piBoardRS485
This repository provides the details of how to build a custom DAQ system based on the RS-485 communication protocol. The primary advantage to the RS-485 protocol is that it allows multiple devices to operate on a single communication line, and that single communication line is the commonly available ethernet cord. This line interfaces with other commonly used communciation standards and connectors, such as GPIB and RS-232, via custom circuit boards, which can be ordered online using the Gerber files located in this repository.

THe system was originally developed to be controlled by a RaspberryPi, but could work with other devices that support serial communication.

A full overview of the project is given in [the pdf document describing the project](https://github.com/tranthamkw/piBoardRS485/blob/master/PROJECTDESCRIPTIONUniversalDataAcq_RS485_system.pdf).
